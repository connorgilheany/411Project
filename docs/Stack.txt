A document explaining why we chose our current technology stack.

We chose Node and Express primarily because of how many beginner resources there are. There are YouTube videos, blog posts, and Stack Overflow wisdom that helped guide us create this current demo. Although we are strong advocates of the mighty Python language and considered a Python/Flask stack, we all wanted to learn something new and felt a Python/Flask app would not fit that thirst. As of now, we’re thinking of using Mongodb as our database, but are open to using MySQL as well. We faced many challenges so far, but managed to get through with this working demo. We faced issues with variable scope, and asynchronous callbacks as there would be the race condition where we don’t get the value fast enough. Due to our determination to stay inside just like the purpose of our web app, we stayed inside and fixed our problems together.
